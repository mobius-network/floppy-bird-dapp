# Mobius Floppy Bird DApp

Sample Mobius DApp Store application implemented using Ruby and the [Mobius DApp Store Ruby SDK](https://github.com/mobius-network/mobius-client-ruby).

## Setup

1. Run:
```
bundle
mobius-cli create dev-wallet
mv dev-wallet.html public/
```   

2. Start the server with `rails s`

3. Open http://localhost:3000/dev-wallet.html and copy the Application Private Key.

4. Open config/secrets.yml and paste the secret key in the shared/app/secret_key value.

```
shared:
  app:
    secret_key: PASTE_SECRET_KEY_HERE
    jwt_secret: 431714aa54beec753975eaffba3db12d43d4ee52cafeb3ddcdbea05903e3a3ee78ff1f49d56b23df16597bc15f6d6099aef2f668aa38f957ffc960a5445aa8fb
```

5. Stop the server (Ctrl + C)

## Testing

1. Start the server with `rails s`

2. Visit http://localhost:3000/dev-wallet.html

3. Click Open under Normal Account.

4. Play Floppy Bird! Note when you click to start playing there is a pause of a couple seconds because it is in real-time making a blockchain payment! In a real app you would withdraw a larger number of MOBI at once to have some locally on deposit for the user to charge against.
